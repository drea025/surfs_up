## Overview

The goal of this analysis is pull weather data from Oahu, Hawaii for the months of June and December in order to determine if opening a surf and ice cream shop is a good idea. The weather data will help predict if the business can be sustained year-round. 

## Results

Looking at the temperatures for June, on average summer days are about 75 degrees Fahrenheit, highest it 85 and lowest is 64 degrees, which is still relatively warm in comparison to west coast winter temperatures.

At the end of the year, in the month of December the average temp lies in the lower 70's with 71 degrees Fahrenheit, and the lowest at 56 degrees Fahrenheit. Although there is a drop in temperature 71 degrees remains a sustainable temperature to attract surfers to the beach and hopfully indulge in some ice-cream along with surf equipment.

Overall the peak of summer has relativley similar temperatures to the winter season in Oahu. With a few degrees being the difference, both months have an average of 70 degrees Fahrenheit which could lead to a sustainable business. 

Additionaly, we pulled data that displayed the precipitation of Oahu during the same two months to help us determine the chance of rain in the area. Looking at the results the chance of rain remains low, with the avaerage rain fall being 10%-20% chance between both months. Less than half an inch or rain would still allow for business to continue.

## Summary
With the help of this analysis, we can conclude that Oahu would make a great location to establish a surf and ice-cream shop. With this well suited enviroment I encourage the business owners to make Oahu the new spot for Surf'n Shop.
